## Project Overview
We had to use tailwind to create responsive and professional looking footer, complete with an input field and a button, 
as well as two columns of navigation links, as well as a horizontal break and social links.

## Challenges Faced
This project was particularly enjoyable, tailwind makes everything a breeze and it's unbelievable how much you can achieve with vanilla html and then tailwinds classes. 
I really enjoyed using the technology and I found it simplified a lot of CSS personally. The majority of the syntax is incredibly intuitive, and on the odd occassion where you are confused, the documentation
is well constructed and thorough, providing answers swiftly. 

## Final Thoughts
Rather than being a project where I struggled with learning a complex new technology to achieve the desired results, I found this in comparison to be an exercise in 
exploring possibilities with a new technology. Rather than battling to grapple with a new technology, this was different, familiar, yet new. I really enjoyed it and I am particularly keen to experiement with 
Tailwind going forward on some of my personal projects.

I am quite happy with what I am submitting today and I found it so simple to implement consistent responsiveness at different resolutions while at the same time keeping the interface looking very good in my opinion. 
Usually you would expect to have children and parent containers aligned in their respective properties in order to behave with regards to responsiveness, no overflowing grids or images refusing to shrink. This was
not like that, instead with classes such as lg:grid-cols-2 you can easily define the shape of your layout. The nice side of this as well is I had ample space to tinker and fine tune the UI to be exactly what I wanted.
